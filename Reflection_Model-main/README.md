Cybersecurity-Focused Reflective QA System
Agentic Long-Form Answering Pipeline

A hybrid question-answering system purpose-built for cybersecurity use cases. This pipeline combines T5 and GROQ LLMs with agentic reasoning and reflective feedback mechanisms to deliver highly accurate, context-aware answers to complex security queries.

Features
Cybersecurity Domain Expertise – Designed for questions involving CVEs, exploits, vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10, and other threat intelligence.

Agentic Feedback Loops – Uses LLM-generated critique-rewrite cycles to refine response quality over iterations.

Memory-Aware Reasoning – Captures historical user interactions to improve continuity and depth of answers.

Reduced False Positives – Demonstrates up to 35% reduction in misclassified vulnerabilities through reflection-based enhancement.

Enhanced Accuracy – Outperforms baseline QA models with 92% accuracy and 40% better answer relevance.

Technologies Used
GROQ LLM – Handles reflective critique and iterative rewriting

T5 Transformer – Base model for question-answer generation

Agentic Patterns – Structured critique-rewrite loops for self-improvement

Python, TensorFlow – Core logic and ML model management

LangChain / LangGraph (optional) – For routing, chaining tools, and building memory-aware components
